Basic Translator
Made during Boolean Coding Week
Absolute first attempt using Javascript and APIs

free API service used: 
https://api.mymemory.translated.net/get?q=${text}&langpair=it|${lang}

I have no idea how many mistakes or missing things there might be, 
I was and I am still starting out with programming in general. 

I'm here to learn. ^^

If there's some more information I should add please let me know, somehow.
